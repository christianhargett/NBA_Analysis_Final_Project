# NBA_Analysis_Final_Project

## Team Members: Shaun Stewart & Christian Hargett

# Selected Topic: 
•	Examining the different variables of the NBA and determining which have the most effect on winning.

# Reason why topic was selected: 
•	There are a lot of interesting things to be pulled from the vast amount of data that the NBA has for their players and teams. In some ways, understanding the dynamics in which a   team is more poised to win or to lose in critical in variety of situations would be very helpful. This could be anything from winning a simple argument with friend about “Does     defense actually win championships or does offensive stats matter more?” to who is the opportune player to pick up off of the waiver wire in Fantasy Sports. I think there is       rise for some interesting outputs to come from looking at this dataset. 

# Description of source of data:
•	 For this project, we have a couple of different options here. There have been some good datasets produced from the NBA database that already exist on sites like Kaggle. However, in order to be able to have this as a reusable model and project, we would like to figure out how to scrape the correct data from one of the major NBA-related databases such as basketball-reference.com or nba.com/stats.

# Questions that we hope to answer with the data:
•	Based on the data that we’ve seen from the past in relation to the NBA, we believe that we might be able to answer the following questions: <br>
    - What is the biggest factor for wins in the NBA? <br>
    - Is there a particular position that accounts for the most wins in the NBA? <br>
    - What factors can we use and accurately predict player usage and win chances? <br>

# Machine Learning Model:
•	For our project, we will have several different models based on the questions that we are hoping to answer: 
  - Supervised Machine Learning – Classification and Regression <br>
         - Multiple linear regressions for looking the different variables and their relationships <br>

Dashboard: 
•	Either Tableau or JavaScript (or both) 
    •	Would like to show our work as well as create a cool medium for our project to be seen through
