# NBA_Analysis_Final_Project

## Team Members: Shaun Stewart & Christian Hargett

# Selected Topic: 
•	Examining the different variables of the NBA and determining which have the most effect on winning.

# Reason why topic was selected: 
•	There are a lot of interesting things to be pulled from the vast amount of data that the NBA has for their players and teams. In some ways, understanding the dynamics in which a   team is more poised to win or to lose in critical in variety of situations would be very helpful. This could be anything from winning a simple argument with friend about “Does     defense actually win championships or does offensive stats matter more?” to who is the opportune player to pick up off of the waiver wire in Fantasy Sports. I think there is       rise for some interesting outputs to come from looking at this dataset. 

# Description of source of data:
•	 For our project, we have utilized a couple of datafiles from Kaggle that have been scrapped directly from the stats.nba.com website. We have also ensured that our data files and the different variables that are within can be tied back to the naming from the NBA API. Below are links to both the data files on Kaggle, as well as, the NBA API information that we used to check. 
### API:
-    https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-nba/details <br>
-    https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/ <br>

### Kaggle:
-    https://www.kaggle.com/nathanlauga/nba-games

# Questions that we hope to answer with the data:
•	Based on the data that we’ve seen from the past in relation to the NBA, we believe that we might be able to answer the following questions: <br>
    - What is the biggest factor for wins in the NBA? <br>
    - Is there a particular position that accounts for the most wins in the NBA? <br>
    - What factors can we use and accurately predict player usage and win chances? <br>

# Machine Learning Model:

## Modeling in Python
•	For our project, we will have several different models based on the questions that we are hoping to answer: 

### SVC Model <br>

### Logistic Regression <br>

## Modeling in R 
•	Multiple linear regressions and correlations were done in R <br>
-	Multiple linear regressions of Games Data <br>
